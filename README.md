# Glasspay — Community Finance Platform

Glasspay is a community finance platform. Communities (schools, cooperatives, associations, clubs) collect and track dues, payment plans, and settlements; their members pay and manage their own obligations through a mobile-first app.

This repository is the **frontend**: a Vite + React SPA covering the member app, community-admin dashboard, platform admin panel, onboarding, and public landing pages. It is deployed at **app.glasspay.app** and talks to a separate Spring Boot backend API.

## Architecture Overview

### Two-Repo Setup

| Repo | Deploys to | Purpose |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| `glass-waitlist` (this repo) | `app.glasspay.app` | The product — auth, dashboards, member app |
| `glass-waitlist-v1` | `glasspay.app` | Marketing site only |

Landing components in this repo are the **source of truth** but do not auto-sync to the marketing repo. Cross-domain navigation goes through `goToApp()` (`src/utils/deviceRedirect.js`), never raw `navigate()`.

### Authorization Model

- **Platform roles:** `SUPER_ADMIN`, `OPERATIONS_ADMIN`, `COMPLIANCE_ADMIN` grant platform-wide admin access.
- **Community roles:** `COMMUNITY_OWNER`, `COMMUNITY_ADMIN` grant community management access. `TREASURER`, `COLLECTIONS_OFFICER`, `VIEWER`, `COMMUNITY_MEMBER` do not.
- **Guards** (`src/routes/`) are UX/access-routing only. The **backend is the authority** for permissions.

### Session System

Token refresh is single-flight with cross-tab lease coordination (`src/api/refreshCoordinator.js`). A logout that wins a race is never undone by an in-flight refresh. See `docs/authentication.md`.

## Contributing

1. Create a short-lived `feature/` or `fix/` branch from `main`.
2. Run the full validation suite before opening a PR:

   ```bash
   npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build
   ```

3. Open a PR into `main` using the repo template (summary, test plan, checklist).
4. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style subjects.
5. Never commit directly to `main`.
