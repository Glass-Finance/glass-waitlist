// Payment/transaction/obligation status semantics.
//
// Every backend status literal the frontend interprets, in one place. These
// are pure classifiers (status -> boolean): they never fetch, never mutate,
// and depend on nothing. Data-shaping normalization (e.g. SUCCESSFUL -> PAID)
// stays in `src/hooks/payments/shape.js`; display labels stay with their
// components.
//
// Each set mirrors exactly what the call sites checked before consolidation:
//   - Transactions collect/count as paid on SUCCESS, SUCCESSFUL, or PAID.
//   - The verify endpoint's own success vocabulary is SUCCESS/SUCCESSFUL —
//     PAID is an obligation status and never appears there.
//   - Obligations read as paid on PAID or SUCCESSFUL. The backend obligation
//     enum is PAID/DUE/OVERDUE/WAIVED (see src/api/payments.js), so the
//     SUCCESSFUL arm only ever fires defensively.
//   - Failure is FAILED everywhere it is checked; overdue is OVERDUE.
// Plan-lifecycle statuses (ACTIVE/ARCHIVED/EXPIRED), export-job states,
// payout-account verification, and notification-type tables are different
// axes and deliberately live elsewhere.
//
// All predicates accept raw or shaped statuses in any case. Case folding is
// intentional, not invented: the backend emits uppercase enums, the shaping
// layer uppercases defensively, and the large majority of call sites already
// normalized before comparing — no backend-supported input distinguishes
// the two behaviors.
