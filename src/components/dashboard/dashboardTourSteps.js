// to exist on every screen size -- findValidStep/measure in DashboardTour.jsx
// both check real visibility, not just DOM presence, so e.g. the mobile-menu-button
// step (only rendered md:hidden) is automatically skipped on desktop, and
// topbar-search (only rendered hidden md:block) is automatically skipped
// on mobile, with no separate per-step viewport flag needed.
