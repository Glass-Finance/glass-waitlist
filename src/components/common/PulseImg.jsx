// src/components/common/PulseImg.jsx
//
// Avatar/logo <img> for tiny fixed-size remote assets: shows a pulsing
// skeleton while the file fetches, then fades the real image in. A CSS
// skeleton beats a fetched blur placeholder here — zero extra requests,
// and something is visible before the request even starts (an LQIP fetch
// for a 36px avatar is pure overhead).
//
// The skeleton sits BEHIND the img (the img is opacity-0 until loaded), so
// containers that already carry a background (gradient, initials fallback)
// keep showing it through `bg-transparent` on the skeleton.
//
// SECURITY: every caller feeds this component a URL straight out of an API
// payload — `user.profileImage.url` (/user/me), `logo.url` (invites),
// `item.logo.url` (admin payments) — so the scheme is attacker-influenced the
// same way the four profile-image sinks were before PR #79. Validate here,
// once, rather than at each call site: all four consumers route through this
// component, so centralising the check closes them together.
//
// Reuse the existing `safeImageUrl` validator (pure; returns null rather than
// repairing) — do NOT add a second sanitizer here. A rejected URL takes the
// same no-render path a missing src already took, which is why the component
// keeps its "renders nothing" contract instead of guessing a fallback image.
//
// `srcSet` is destructured out and discarded. `...imgProps` is spread BEFORE
// `src`, and an HTML `srcset` with a matching candidate makes the browser
// ignore `src` entirely — so an unvalidated `srcSet` would otherwise be a
// straight bypass of the check below.
