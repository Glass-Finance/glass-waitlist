// Settings sits deliberately outside CommunityAdminGuard, because the account
// level pages (profile, security, notifications) apply to no single community.
// Its *community-scoped* children are guarded, though — Community Profile,
// Member Access and Payout Account all live under CommunityAdminGuard, which
// fails closed by redirecting to /dashboard/home whenever it can't resolve a
// community the user actually administers.
//
// That redirect is correct as a security boundary but useless as UX: arriving
// from CommunitiesHome (which intentionally carries no ?community=, since its
// whole job is choosing one) meant the menu offered links that silently
// bounced back to the same page, reading as broken buttons. These tests pin
// that this page now explains the situation instead of guessing a community,
// and that it threads ?community= explicitly once one is genuinely resolved.
//
// The invariant that matters most: never silently pick a community. Not the
// first one, not a default, not any. useActiveCommunityId resolves exactly
// three ways (?community=, the glass_community snapshot, or null) and these
// tests must not grow a fourth.
