//
// So the distinction these tests pin is between a community that was actually
// *chosen* (?community=, or a stored selection that still resolves) and one
// the sidebar merely inferred. Inferring is fine for keeping a single-community
// admin's nav live on a bare deep link, but persisting it would spread an
// unchosen community past the sidebar into every community-scoped surface --
// and with two or more admin communities there is nothing to infer from
// without guessing, since [0] is just whatever the backend ordered first.
//
// Note the sidebar is deliberately *not* the authority on whether a ?community=
// is permitted. CommunityAdminGuard fails closed and bounces unauthorized
// destinations; the sidebar's job is only to stop substituting a different
// community for the one the URL names.
