/**
 * Remove every complete HTML comment, scanning explicitly rather than by regex.
 *
 * This exists because a wrong answer here produces a wrong CSP hash, and a wrong
 * CSP hash is a production break that only surfaces as a browser console error.
 * The previous `html.replace(/<!--[\s\S]*?-->/g, "")` is flagged by CodeQL as
 * `js/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization`.
 *
 * Scope of the actual defect, verified against the old implementation rather
 * than assumed: the lazy `[\s\S]*?` handles ADJACENT and NESTED comment markers
 * correctly, because `-->` legitimately ends a comment in HTML and the regex
 * resumes after it. What it does NOT do is notice an UNTERMINATED `<!--`. It
 * silently returns the input unchanged, so a comment that is never closed leaves
 * the rest of the file unstripped -- and if that comment mentions a <script> in
 * prose (the exact case this stripper was added for), that commented-out code
 * gets hashed as though it were a real inline script. The maintainer then pastes
 * a hash for dead content into vercel.json while the real inline script goes
 * unhashed and is blocked in production.
 *
 * So the fix is to fail loudly rather than to guess: an unterminated `<!--` is an
 * error, never a silent pass-through, because a partial strip produces a
 * confidently wrong hash and a confidently wrong CSP.
 *
 * Deliberately not a general HTML parser. This only needs to know where comments
 * begin and end, and it refuses to guess: an unterminated `<!--` is an error,
 * never a partial strip, because silently returning truncated HTML would produce
 * a confidently wrong hash.
 *
 * @param {string} html
 * @returns {string} the input with every complete comment removed
 * @throws {Error} if a `<!--` has no terminating `-->`
